## How?

1 - Create a Lobby, TFT/ARAM/SoloQ... whatever. <br/>
2 - Open Crash.exe <br/>
3 - Get SummonerID by Nickname. <br/>
4 - Spam. <br/>

### Requirements
.NET Framework 4.7.2

### Issues
If the app isn't kicking the user from room immediately after inviting, maybe it's a rate limit of the API and the Server you are using has down.
