## How?

1 - Create a Lobby, TFT/ARAM/SoloQ... whatever. <br/>
2 - Open Crash.exe <br/>
3 - Get SummonerID by Nickname. <br/>
4 - Spam. <br/>

### Requirements
.NET Framework 4.7.2

### Issues [ATTENTION]
This is partially working due to changes in the Riot API, it looks like theyâ€™ve noticed the problem and are trying to fix it. It still works, but it's slower. I am working to try new ways.

If the app isn't kicking the user from room immediately after inviting, maybe it's a rate limit of the API and the Server you are using has down.
Be caution using this bcoz this is considered a crime depending on the country where u live. Denial-of-service is a crime and I am not responsible for your actions.
